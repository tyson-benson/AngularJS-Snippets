# AngularJS Code Snippets for Visual Studio

Here is a collection of code snippets for Visual Studio that speed up the development of AngularJS applications. These code snippets are based on the work of [angularjs-livetpls](https://github.com/angularjs-livetpls/angularjs-webstorm-livetpls) with a few additions. Such as:

* More snippets for writing Jasmine (expect...)
* A couple general purpose JavaScript snippets (anonymous function, immediately invoke function expression)
* HTML snippets for using built-in AngularJS directives (attribute style only, at present)

These snippets have been tested in Visual Studio 2012, but I expect them to work in VS2005+ (let me know if they don't, or submit a pull request).
